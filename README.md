**PROG8850 - Database Automation**

**Students:**  
• Prem Chander J — Student ID: 9015480  
• Rishi Patel — Student ID: 8972657

## Overview
This assignment analyzes database performance improvements through strategic indexing using the Brazilian E-commerce dataset (~100,000 orders). We test scalar field queries and full-text searches, measuring execution times before and after implementing indexes.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** installed and running
- **Python 3.7+** with pip
- **Git** (to clone this repository)

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended - What was actually used)

```powershell
# 1. Clone/Navigate to the project directory
cd "c:\Users\premc\OneDrive\Documentos\DatabaseAutomation\PROG8850-Assignment5"

# 2. Start Docker MySQL container
docker-compose -f mysql-adminer.yml up -d

# 3. Wait for MySQL to fully initialize (30-60 seconds)
docker logs prog8850-assignment5-db-1

# 4. Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# 5. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 6. Load database schema
Get-Content ecommerce_schema.sql | docker exec -i prog8850-assignment5-db-1 mysql -u root -pSecret5555

# 7. Run the performance tests
python docker_performance_tester.py
```

### Option 2: Direct MySQL Setup (Alternative)

```powershell
# 1. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Test database connection
python test_connection.py

# 3. Set up database schema
mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -pSecret5555 < ecommerce_schema.sql

# 4. Run performance tests
python performance_tester.py
```

### Verification Steps

```powershell
# Check if containers are running
docker ps

# Access MySQL directly
docker exec -it prog8850-assignment5-db-1 mysql -u root -pSecret5555

# Access Adminer web interface
# Open browser to: http://localhost:8080
# Server: db, Username: root, Password: Secret5555
```

## Dataset Information

### Original Dataset
Download the Brazilian E-commerce dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?resource=download):
- ~100,000 real e-commerce orders
- 9 CSV files with normalized data
- Requires Kaggle account to download

### Sample Dataset (Included)
For testing purposes, we provide a sample dataset generator that creates:
- 500+ customers, 1000+ orders
- 2000+ order items with realistic pricing
- 800+ customer reviews for full-text testing
- Complete relational integrity

## Database Schema

The database includes these main tables:
- **customers**: Customer demographics and locations
- **orders**: Order lifecycle and status tracking  
- **order_items**: Product details, pricing, freight costs
- **products**: Product catalog with categories
- **sellers**: Merchant information
- **order_reviews**: Customer feedback (full-text searchable)
- **order_payments**: Payment methods and installments

## Testing Methodology

### Scalar Field Tests
- Price range filtering and aggregations
- Date-based order queries
- Multi-table joins with WHERE clauses
- COUNT, SUM, AVG operations

### Full-Text Search Tests  
- Simple MATCH...AGAINST queries
- Boolean mode searches with operators
- Phrase matching and relevance scoring
- Combined text search with aggregations

### Performance Metrics
- Query execution time measurement
- EXPLAIN plan analysis
- Before/after indexing comparisons
- Resource utilization assessment

## Results Summary

### Performance Improvements
- **Scalar queries**: 86-98% faster execution
- **Full-text searches**: 91-93% performance gain
- **Query plans**: Changed from full table scans to index seeks
- **User experience**: Sub-second response times achieved

### Index Strategy
1. Single-column indexes on frequently filtered fields
2. Composite indexes for multi-column WHERE clauses  
3. Full-text indexes for natural language search
4. Strategic covering indexes to avoid table lookups

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Docker Container Not Starting
```powershell
# Check if Docker Desktop is running
docker --version

# Stop and restart containers
docker-compose -f mysql-adminer.yml down
docker-compose -f mysql-adminer.yml up -d

# Check container logs
docker logs prog8850-assignment5-db-1
```

#### 2. Python Virtual Environment Issues
```powershell
# Recreate virtual environment
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Database Connection Failed
```powershell
# Wait for MySQL to fully initialize (60 seconds)
docker logs prog8850-assignment5-db-1 | Select-String "ready for connections"

# Test connection manually
docker exec -it prog8850-assignment5-db-1 mysql -u root -pSecret5555 -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
```

#### 4. Permission Denied Errors
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
# Or use alternative method
python test_connection.py
```

### Alternative Testing Methods

If Docker setup fails, you can use:
- `sqlite_performance_tester.py` - SQLite-based demonstration
- `performance_tester.py` - Direct MySQL connection (requires local MySQL)

## Notes

To run the basic project:

```bash
ansible-playbook up.yml
```

To use mysql:

```bash
mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -p
```

To run github actions like (notice that the environment variables default for the local case):

```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install MySQL client
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y mysql-client

      - name: Deploy to Database
        env:
          DB_HOST: ${{ secrets.DB_HOST || '127.0.0.1' }} 
          DB_USER: ${{ secrets.DB_ADMIN_USER || 'root' }}
          DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD  || 'Secret5555'}}
          DB_NAME: ${{ secrets.DB_NAME || 'mysql' }}
        run: mysql -h $DB_HOST -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME < schema_changes.sql
```

locally:

first try

```bash
bin/act
```

then if that doesn't work 

```bash
bin/act -P ubuntu-latest=-self-hosted
```

to run in the codespace.

To shut down:

```bash
ansible-playbook down.yml
```

There is also a flyway migration here. To run the migration:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "/workspaces/<repo name>/migrations:/flyway/sql" redgate/flyway -user=root -password=Secret5555 -url=jdbc:mysql://172.17.0.1:3306/flyway_test migrate
```

This is a reproducible mysql setup, with a flyway migration. It is also the start of an example of using flyway and github actions together. Flyway (jdbc) needs the database to exist. The github action creates it if it doesn't exist and flyway takes over from there.
